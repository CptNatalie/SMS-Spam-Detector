# SMS Spam Detector

This project houses the SMS Spam Detection App, designed to classify text messages as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques. The app is built on top of Gradio, allowing for an interactive and user-friendly interface. It uses a pipeline comprising TF-IDF vectorization and Linear Support Vector Classification to process and predict the nature of the text messages.
