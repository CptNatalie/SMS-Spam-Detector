# SMS Spam Detector
This project involves refactoring code for a binary text classification model. Implement an SMS text classification solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. Use Gradio to host the application, enabling users to test text messages. The application will provide feedback to users, indicating whether the text is classified as spam or not.
